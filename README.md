# Learn image segmentation using PyTorch

First, I recommend to read the notebook **main-techniques.ipynb**. 

There you will learn about upsampling methods (simple scaling and transposed convolutions), skip connections, evalution (IoU and Dice Score) and other useful techniques used in the field of image segmentation.

## Image Segmentation models:
- [ ] Fully Convolutional Networks (SegNet)
- [ ] FCN-32, FCN-16, FCN-8
- [x] U-Net
- [ ] Mobile UNet
- [ ] Mask R-CNN
- [ ] PSPNet: Pyramid Scene Parsing Network
- [ ] BiSeNet: Bilateral Segmentation Network (real-time)
- [ ] DeepLabV3+
- [ ] Segmenter: Vision transformers applied to semantic image segmentation.
